description: Synthesize the current conversation and project evidence into a buildable spec using the project's existing artifact convention. Use when discussion is ready to become a spec rather than starting another interview.

> Skill Hub file reference: use this method under the target project's rules and task authorization; selecting or reading it runs no command or workflow. Linked methods are optional candidates, not automatic selections or archives; [maintenance notes](../../FILE-REFERENCES.md) are optional current-library guidance, and unprovided files or capabilities must be checked.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec (you may know this document as a PRD). Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

Use the existing project spec location and work-tracking convention. [Project setup guidance](../../meta/setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md) is optional when that convention actually needs defining; an external tracker is not a prerequisite.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Reuse already confirmed testing decisions. Ask about a new seam only when the choice needs a user decision and is not resolved by project evidence.

3. Write the spec using the useful parts of the template below in the authorized project location. Publish to an external tracker and apply its readiness label only when that write is authorized and the configured tools are available; otherwise leave a reviewable local draft. Do not initialize a tracker or invent a successful publication.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
